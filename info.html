            <i>"Everybody's talking about Junior Bill... a genuine grassroots feel, instantly"</i> - Tom Robinson 

            <p >In their four years together, Junior Bill have earnt their chops as performers in small venues, pubs and festivals around the country, honing a sound and stage presence that has lead them to be regarded as one of South Wales’ best live bands. Their educated and eclectic street sound acknowledges the spirit of the Clash, tips its pork pie hat off to Two Tone, and shakes hands with the vanguard of vintage Jamaican dub. It’s a passionately delivered global-local collage of Reggae, Latin, Punk, Portuguese rap and Cardiffian stories, and it’s finding a home in the hearts and minds of people across the country</p>

            <p>Their unconceited Cardiff-centric songs tell of the forgotten people of a rapidly changing city, where cut-and-paste shopping centres are erected whilst youth centres are taken away, ethnic communities are silently ghettoised, conflicted local lads join ISIS and a gang of rats plot to blow up the Mermaid Quay - but we'll all still skank our arses off to them on a Saturday night!</p>
